# OOP Assignment 🚀

This repository contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment in Python.

## 📘 Assignment Tasks

### Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class 
- Created a **Smartphone** class with attributes and methods.
- Added a **Smartwatch** class that inherits from Smartphone.
- Demonstrated **inheritance** and **method overriding (polymorphism)**.

### Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge 🎭
- Created classes **Car, Plane, Boat**, each with a `move()` method.
- Showed polymorphism by calling `move()` on each object, producing different outputs:
  - Car → "Driving 🚗"
  - Plane → "Flying ✈️"
  - Boat → "Sailing ⛵"
